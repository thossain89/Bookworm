# Bookworm

## An online platform to share your thoughts about your favorite books

## User Story  

In recent years covid affected how we used to interact in our daily life. Due to continuous lockdown and other restrictions the local council library has seen a decline in the number of book enthusiasts. It is a really hard time for these book lovers who regularly visit the library and discuss the books they have read. To make life enjoyable for our valued members, the library in charge came up with a brilliant idea of creating an online platform where our members can review and discuss books.
